Attribution and upstream inspiration

This repository includes clean-room reimplementations inspired by public papers
and algorithm descriptions and informed by prior open-source projects:

- ruptures (BSD-2-Clause): change-point detection reference implementations and
  API design inspiration
- bayesian_changepoint_detection (MIT): BOCPD-related formulation and examples

No source code is copied directly from upstream repositories unless license
terms are complied with and attribution requirements are preserved.

See docs/clean_room_policy.md for project clean-room and attribution policy,
including algorithm-to-paper traceability expectations.
